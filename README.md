Java application that takes K-Drama elements and makes a text based game with 100's of items, images, and impossible choices.

The Biggest thing I learned while making this game was the hard work and time that could be saved by making your code modular. I spent the first couple days refactoring logic into modular functions, making it easier to edit and delegate work amongst the team.
